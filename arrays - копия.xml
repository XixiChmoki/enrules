        We often use Present Perfect Continuous with 'for', 'since' and 'how long'. We use it if an action happened some time ago and if it's still happening. We form Present Perfect Continuous this way: 1) I/We/You/They + have + been + verb + ing OR He/She/It + has + been + verb + ing 2) I/We/You/They + haven't + been + verb + ing OR He/She/It + hasn't + been + verb + ing 3) How long have + I/we/you/they + been + verb + ing...? OR How long has + he/she/it + been + verb + ing...?
